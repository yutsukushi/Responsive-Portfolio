            <p>Hi there! As you may have found out, my name is Yukie. I am an aspiring User-Interface designer/developer. I have a creative background in 3D modelling, texture design, and rendering, as well as, contemporary paintings.</p>

            <p>Outside of my professional development, I am an aquarium hobbyist, avian enthusiast, animal shelter volunteer and have a definite sweet spot for video games and movies!</p>

                <p>Having the flexibility to thrive in teamwork environments and working solo, I enjoy the process of creation and look forward to working with you!</p>

                <p>Here is my creative portfolio: <a href="https://www.yukushi.com/" target="_blank">https://www.yukushi.com/</a></p>
