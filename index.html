            <img id="picture" src="assets/images/bsns-pic.jpg" alt="A portrait of Yukie Kushibiki">
            <p>Hi there! As you may have found out, my name is Yukie. I am an aspiring User-Interface designer/developer. My interest in user-interface design/development first stemmed from playing old flash games on Yahoo: Yahooligans. It was my first exposure to the World Wide Web and haven't looked back since!</p>
            
            <p>I have a creative background in 3D modelling, texture design, and rendering, as well as, contemporary paintings. I played a visual role for a team in creating an educational game for children in Bosnia to interning for VR/AR start-up companies.</p>

            <p>Outside of my professional development, I am an aquarium hobbyist, avian enthusiast, animal shelter volunteer and have a definite sweet spot for video games and movies! It's definitely safe to say my interests lay in animal welfare. I am also very invested into being environmentally conscious. </p>

            <p>Having the flexibility to thrive in teamwork environments and working solo, I enjoy the process of creation and look forward to working with you!</p>

            <p>Here is my creative portfolio: <a href="https://www.yukushi.com/" target="_blank">https://www.yukushi.com/</a></p>
